# CSV Structure Rules (legacy)

CSV structure is described here **only as reference information** from the old workflow.
The current system creates campaigns **only via Facebook Marketing API**, CSV files are no longer generated.

If there is a need to use CSV export again in the future, this file can be used as a basis for a new implementation.
